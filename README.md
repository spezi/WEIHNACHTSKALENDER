#Arduino and WS2811 Pixel String Christmas Calendar

The Idea is to make a Christmas Calendar with a 50Pcs String of 12mm WS2811 Pixel for my two Children. Every Day one more pixel lights up on both sides by manualy trigger a button. since only 48 Pixel are needed, you have two more Pixel. So you have to start at last day in November ;) Finaly at Christmas Eve, all pixel will show a nice Rainbow Animation.

The Kids gets daily theirs goodies in a little paper breadbag and if empty they can pull it over the pixel of the day ..
